Description: Optimization of the PROTREC algorithm which predicts and
    validates missing proteins based on protein complexes or networks. The
    package includes hyper-parameter tuning (PROTREC score threshold,
    minimum complex size and PROTREC score selection operation) applied in
    different validation scenarios; PROTREC validation using selected
    significant complexes selected from popular protein recovery function,
    such as Functional Class Scoring (FCS); and further validation of
    PROTREC using new liver tissue datasets.
